# ðŸ‘‹ HELLO WORLD

This program prints a *hello world message* for each new *syscall* made by a process.

## ðŸ’» Requirements

This program only requires the `libbpf`.

## ðŸš€ How to Build

You can run the following command line:
```bash
make
```
It will generate the following files:
- `prog` â†’ The program responsible for attaching the eBPF program into the kernel and handling the information stored
- `prog.bpf.ll` â†’ The LLVM IR   
- `prog.bpf.o` â†’ The eBPF object that will be attached to the kernel

## â˜• How to Run

You can run:
```bash
sudo ./prog
```
To test the program, try running the following command line while the eBPF program is running:
```bash
sudo cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace_pipe
```
