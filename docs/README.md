Pay extra attention to the folders of Examples if you are a user and Lib/Honey and Docs if you wish to become a contributor.

## Assets
Contains the logo of Honey-Potion and other images used for documentation.

## Benchmarks
Contains tools and examples for transforming C code into runnable eBPF programs. Divided into 3 folders:
### programs
Contains examples of C code that can be viewed as our "target" when using honey with an elixir project.
### libs
Contains the libraries for eBPF.
### tools
Contains the tools for eBPF.

## Lib/Honey
This is where the code for Honey-Potion resides. In other words, this is what does the process of turning an elixir code into a C counterpart. See Honey.md on this folder for more details.

### c_libraries
Contains the definitions of the sub-modules we translate to C. Depending on IDE this allows auto-complete.

### mix_methods
Contains code that is used when doing mix operations, like mix compile.

## Priv
Contains code that has to be persisted in the Hex documentation and contains the runtime functions and structures that represent basic elixir operations in C.

## Test
A folder generated by mix that isn't in use currently.

## Examples
A folder created to represent what a user of elixir would have. Contains the same behaviours as a user's folder when Elixir is added as a dependency. Look into here for examples of code and structures that can be translated.

## Docs
Contains the documentation of Honey-Potion project as an overview. Documentation of specific parts of code is currently handled with intuitive naming or comments.
